General Approach:
    - get simulated system configuration and process data
        - for each line of input taken, input must be completely validated
          against specification and against already taken input
    - log simulation start
    - until simulation finishes:
        - run simulation until at least one event occurs
            - for each simulation tick
                - keep list of events to be appended to at any point
                - if list is empty at the end, just proceed to next tick
        - log event(s) and status
    - log simulation result
    - log simulation end

Notes and Assumptions:
    - for a given simulation time, order of event and status output lines does
      not matter (as long as the information is accurrate).
    - program does not run persistently, so allocated memory will not be freed
      for the sake of performance and simplicity.

General Approach:
    - get simulated system configuration and process data
        - for each line of input taken, input must be completely validated
          against specification and against already taken input
    - log simulation start
    - until simulation finishes:
        - run simulation until at least one event occurs
        - log event(s)
    - log simulation result
    - log simulation end

Notes and Assumptions:
    - program does not run persistently, so allocated memory will not be freed
      for the sake of performance and simplicity.

TODO:
    - in run simulation (move this to general approach)
        - increment sim time
        - for each process
            - if start time is sim time or state is idle
                - if can serve request
                    - set to running
                    - subtract from available resources
                - if cannot serve request
                    - set to idle
                - if running and duration > 0
                    - decrement duration
                - if running and duration == 0
                    - release resources
                    - set to finished

    - create the events and pop them in the queue

    - print the events

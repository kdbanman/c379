General Approach
================

Both servers start identically during setup phase, and both have a similarly
structured listen loop.

For each client connection:
    - Threaded server spawns a thread.
        - detach automatic resource cleanup
    - Forked server forks a child process
        - child processes inherit client socket fd
        - shared memory necessary to use mutex (munmap at end!)
            - see lab/mutex/forky.c

Both servers handle clients with the exact same function, though the threaded
server's handler is wrapped to receive arguments in `void *` form.

Much implementation is shared between both servers:
    - server_conf
    - server_util
    - log_monitor


Client Handler
==============

1. Takes a single accepted socket and reads the sent data.
2. Attempts to validate the request format by parsing it into a struct
3. Checks if requested file exists with a stat call
4. Constructs response with pointer/length pair
    1. Checks file with stat call
    2. Attempts to read file into malloced string.
5. Constructs response string.
6. Frees response string and request struct.
7. Closes socket.


Assumptions
===========

- HTTP requests are valid if prepended by any amount of newlines
    see: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4

- HTTP responses need not be terminated by any particular sequence/flag
